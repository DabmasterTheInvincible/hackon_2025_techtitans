## Problem Statement

Trust & Safety teams face alert overload, inconsistent insights, and slow decision cycles when handling marketplace risks. TSCC addresses these challenges by providing an intelligent, real-time platform that aggregates agent outputs, applies dynamic rules, and generates LLM-powered investigation briefs to surface only high-priority cases.

## Features

Super Agent Routing: Uses Model Context Protocol (MCP) to distribute event data to specialized sub-agents.

Sub-Agent Processing: Dedicated agents analyze fraud, counterfeit, review-spam, and return patterns.

LLM-Powered Briefs: Gemma-generated summaries for analysts with key risk metrics and context.

React Dashboard: UI to triage alerts, drill into MCP context, and take actions like "Confirm Fraud" or "Escalate".
